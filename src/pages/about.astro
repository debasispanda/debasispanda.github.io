    <Heading>About Me</Heading>
    <h2 class="my-4 text-xl font-bold">Programmer | Traveller | Master Chef</h2>
    <p class="my-2">
      With over a decade of experience in software development, I am passionate
      about building robust and scalable solutions across diverse domains.
      Currently I work primarily with TypeScript, React, and NodeJS, and I’ve
      used Angular and Python on several projects.
    </p>
    <p class="my-2">
      As a skilled full-stack developer, I specialize in designing and
      implementing highly scalable applications using microservices
      architecture. My focus is on designing clean, maintainable systems: solid
      typing, modular architecture, automated testing, and performance-aware
      implementations.
    </p>

    <p class="my-2">
      My adaptability and eagerness to learn new technologies have enabled me to
      quickly master modern tools and practices, making me a valuable asset to
      any team. On this site I document practical solutions to real problems —

      If you read my posts you’ll find code samples, step-by-step guides, and
      the reasoning that shaped my choices. I aim for posts that help you solve
      the same problems faster and with fewer surprises.

      Beyond code, I am an avid traveller and food lover, always eager to
      explore new places, cultures, and cuisines. My interests extend to travel
      blogging, photography, road trips, and all things automotive—especially
      bikes and cars, which are a constant source of excitement for me.
